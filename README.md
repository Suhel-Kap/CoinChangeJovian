## CoinChangeJovian
This is the course project I did while doing Jovian.ai's python data structures and algorithms.
We were supposed to take a problem from any platform and solve it, first using a *brute force* solution and then an optimized solution
I solved [this](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/coin-change/problem) problem using the **memoization** technique and was able to compute large calculations within 5 ms
I've also solved it using a **dynamic programming** approach and was able to acheive run times as low as 0.5 ms
